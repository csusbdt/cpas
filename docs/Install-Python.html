      <h1>CSE 1010</h1>
<p>This course requires Python3.  This page describes how to install Python 3 on your computer.</p>
<h2>Windows computers</h2>
<p>If Python is not already installed on your Windows computer, then see the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download">downloads page</a> of the Python Beginner's Guide.</p>
<p>TODO: Video of installation, showing how to determine which installation package to download.</p>
<h2>OS X and Linux computers</h2>
<p>Later version of Mac OS X and many distributions of Linux include Python pre-installed.  However, it's a good idea to check that Python is installed and ready for use.  To do this, open a command line window, also call a <em>terminal window</em>, and enter the command to run the Python command line interpreter as follows.</p>
<pre><code>python
</code></pre>

<p>If it leaves you at the Python command line, signified by 3 <em>greater than</em> symbols, then Python is installed.  You can exit the command line interpreter by holding down the control key and pressing the D key.  (This inserts an <em>end of file</em> character into the command line's input stream.)</p>
<p>If instead you receive a message saying <em>command not found</em>, or something to that effect, then Python is not installed on your system.  See the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download">downloads page</a> of the Python Beginner's Guide for installation instructions.</p>

<li><a href="">OS X demonstration video</a> </li>
<li>Linux is similar to OS X.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to install Python3 in Mac OS X to exist alongside pre-installed Python 2</h2>
<p>The command line tools from Xcode are needed.  If you do not have Xcode, then you should install it from the App Store.</p>
<p>After installing Xcode, run <code>xcode-select --install</code> in the terminal command line to install the command line tools.</p>
<p>You need to install Brew.  Enter <code>brew</code> at the command line to see if you have Brew already installed.  If the command isn't found, install it with the following command.</p>
<pre><code>ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you can run python3 with the following command.</p>
<pre><code>python3
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/csusbdt/cpas/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> for instructions on how to setup
and use Python3 in a virtual environment, which you will need to do if you are using the lab machines
or other machine on which you do not have administrator privileges.</p>
