<h1>CSE 1010 Introduction to Computer Programming</h1>
<p>Students learn to code using a scripting language such as Python or Javascript.
Language syntax, basic data types, control flow, functions, classes, data structures,
command line and graphical user interfaces, application programming interfaces (APIs),
automation experiments in one or more application areas such as animation, simulation, web publishing, etc. 
(3 units)</p>

<h2>Pedagogy</h2>
<p>This course will use writing to support learning in the following ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use writing to support the attainment of skills.  A learning history is a written record of what you read, thought about and experimented with when trying to develop a new skill needed to solve a problem.</li>
<li>Use writing to support problem solving tasks.  Students write documentation as part of the process of solving computer programming problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students will maintain a personal wiki to develop their writing skills.
They will format wiki text using Markdown syntax.
They may optionally maintain source code in a Git repository.</p>
<p>Apply the scientific method to personal learning tasks.  Easy-to-knock-off experiments tempt the learner into guessing. However, experiments should lead to improvements in conceptual understanding. To gain this benefit, students need to formulate clear hypotheses based on their conceptual understanding before running computer programming experiments. If the outcome of the experiment is contrary to the prediction, the student needs to adjust their conceptual models.</p>
<p>Think about and discuss the creative process of learning.</p>
<p>All lectures are videos that can be viewed at any time.  On-campus meetings of 3 hours per week are activity sessions
in which students focus on problem solving, collaboration, research and programming experiments.  It is also time
for examinations and general discussion.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Grades will be based on assignments, quizzes and exams.</p>
<h2>General Education Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>This course is designed to satisfy the A3 Critical Thinking category of the general education program.
The GE learning outcomes include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning How to Learn/Metacognition - Develop awareness of their learning processes, becoming reflective, self-directed learners who are able to apply and adapt their processes of learning in new contexts.</li>
<li>Thinking Critically - Think critically, evaluate, analyze, and solve problems employing multiple methods of reasoning.</li>
<li>Critical Literacies - Analyze the ways that information, including quantitative and technological, oral and written, both shape and are shaped by social contexts.</li>
<li>Ethical Responsibility - Recognize that they are ethically responsible for the impact that their
ideas, decisions, and actions have upon their lives and local and global communities. </li>
</ul>
