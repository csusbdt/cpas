<h2>Reference</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/">Blender Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/getting_started/installing/index.html">Install Blender</a>.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/command_line/introduction.html">Advanced &gt; Command Line &gt; Introduction</a>
to learn how to run Blender from the command line.
On my Mac, I launched Blender from the command line with the following command.</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender
</code></pre>

<p>If you are running under Mac OS X, then you can create an alias to allow easier access to blender from the command line.
One way to do this is add the following to <em>.bash_profile</em> in your home directory.</p>
<pre><code>alias blender=/Applications/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the above command I used is different than the example shown in the Blender documentation.  You may need to similarly adjust what you read in the documentation.</p>
<p>Take careful notice of <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/command_line/arguments.html#argument-order">Argument Order</a>
when running Blender from the command line.</p>
<h2>Experiment with the command line</h2>
<p>When you first start Blender, it will show a cube.
This cube is in a scene with a camera pointed at it.
When you render the scene, you do it through this camera.
In this experiment, we will generate an image of the cube
as seen through the camera.</p>
<p>Run Blender and observe the grey box.</p>
<p>Save the current state of Blender as a Blend-file.
Save it into a convenient location and name the file <em>cube.blend</em>.</p>
<p>From the command line, run the following to produce the first frame
of animation (frame 0) as seen through the camera.</p>
<pre><code>blender -b cube.blend -o //#.png -f 0
</code></pre>

<p>This command will generate an image file named <em>0.png</em>.
Verify that this file is an image of the Blender scene you saved.
The <code>-b</code> in the command specifies that Blender is to run in the background.
In other words, the command will not open the Blender application Window.</p>
<p>To better understand Blender's command line operation, read the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/command_line/index.html">Command Line</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/workflows/command_line.html">Docs » Render » Workflows » Command Line</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The above command uses the blender render engine; try the following to see the results with the Cycles render engine.</p>
<pre><code>blender -b box.blend -o //#.png --engine CYCLES -f 0
</code></pre>

<p>Let's now run a trivial Python script through Blender on the command line.
For this purpose, create <em>hi.py</em> with a single line of Python code: <code>print('hi')</code>.
Test that the script runs as expected.</p>
<pre><code>python hi.py
</code></pre>

<p>The script should display <em>hi</em>.</p>
<p>Now have Blender run the script.</p>
<pre><code>blender -b -P hi.py
</code></pre>

<p>This command produces the same result: it displays <em>hi</em> (along with some extra information from Blender).</p>
<p>To prepare yourself for eventual problems, repeat the above experiment with a syntax error.
For example, you could change <em>hi.py</em> to <code>xprint('hi')</code>.</p>
<p>Read and do the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/python_console.html">Docs » Editors » Python Console</a>
tutorial.</p>
<p>In the Blender editor, SHIFT-F4 selects Console view and SHIFT-F5 selects 3D view.</p>
<h1>TODO:</h1>
<p>I'm reading <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/scripting/index.html">Scripting and Extending Blender</a>
and thinking about going through a video tutorial.</p>
<p>Must check out the <a href="https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts">Blender Add-ons Catalog</a>;
it contains scripts to add geometry and do other interesting things.</p>
<p><strong>TODO: RESTART FROM HERE</strong></p>
<p><strong>New challenge:</strong> write a script that turns on halo rendering for the box.</p>
<p>Problem: Render text or a simple cube from the command line.
Use <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/blender_render/materials/special_effects/halo.html">Halo Rendering</a>.</p>
<p>The following is an example of rendering an animation from the command line.</p>
<pre><code>blender --background --enable-autoexec myanim.blend --render-anim
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>--enable-autoexec</em> option will run initialization scripts in myanim.blend.</p>
<p>Note that the argument order on the Blender command line is significant.</p>
<p>The next thing I read was <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/index.html">Data System</a>.</p>
<p>The following are notes I took from 
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/introduction.html">Data System &gt; Introduction</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Blender UI includes an Outliner editor that lets you view the hierarchical structure of the blend-file.</li>
<li>Various data such as images can be <em>packed</em> in a blend-file.</li>
<li>Most data in a blend-file is in a <em>data-block</em> although some data is not, such as bones, sequence strips and vertex groups.</li>
<li>Use custom properties to store arbitrary data in data-blocks, bones, sequence strips.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are notes I took from
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/scenes/index.html">Data System &gt; Scenes</a></p>
<p>The scene properties that may be relevant to our problem include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>camera -- currently selected camera</li>
<li>background -- true if the scene will be used as a background to another scene</li>
<li>active clip -- not sure what this is</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are notes I took from
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/files/relative_paths.html">Data System &gt; Relative Paths</a>.</p>
<p>You cannot enter relative paths into a new untitled blend-file; save it before linking to external files.</p>
<p>From the <em>Save As</em> function, you have the option to select <em>Remap Relative</em> to relocate a blend-file relative to its linked resources.</p>
<p><em>Optional Assignment:</em> Create an <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/app_templates.html">Application Template</a> that is used with your scene generation code.</p>
<p>Make note of <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/troubleshooting/python.html">Python Errors</a>.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/glossary/index.html">Glossary</a> as needed.</p>
<p>Do a cursory reading of <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/modeling/index.html">Modeling</a>.</p>
<p>Problem: Create an animation that involves <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/modeling/texts/index.html">Text</a>.</p>
<p>Do a cursory reading of <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/sculpt_paint/index.html">Painting and Sculpting</a>.
Read the overview paragraph of the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/sculpt_paint/sculpting/introduction.html">Introduction to Sculpting</a>.</p>
<p>Do a cursory reading of Read <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/index.html">Render</a>.</p>
