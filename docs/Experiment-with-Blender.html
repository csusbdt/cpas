      <h1>CSE 1010</h1>
<p><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/getting_started/installing/index.html">Install Blender</a>.</p>
<p>Look at <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/">Blender Reference Manual</a>, which is the top-level starting point of the Blender documentation.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/command_line/index.html">Blender Command Line</a>.  The following are my notes to myself from this section.</p>
<p>The following is an example of rendering an animation from the command line.</p>
<pre><code>blender --background --enable-autoexec myanim.blend --render-anim
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>--enable-autoexec</em> option will run initialization scripts in myanim.blend.</p>
<p>Note that the argument order on the Blender command line is significant.</p>
<p>The next thing I read was <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/index.html">Data System</a>.</p>
<p>The following are notes I took from 
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/introduction.html">Data System &gt; Introduction</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Blender UI includes an Outliner editor that lets you view the hierarchical structure of the blend-file.</li>
<li>Various data such as images can be <em>packed</em> in a blend-file.</li>
<li>Most data in a blend-file is in a <em>data-block</em> although some data is not, such as bones, sequence strips and vertex groups.</li>
<li>Use custom properties to store arbitrary data in data-blocks, bones, sequence strips.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are notes I took from
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/scenes/index.html">Data System &gt; Scenes</a></p>
<p>The scene properties that may be relevant to our problem include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>camera -- currently selected camera</li>
<li>background -- true if the scene will be used as a background to another scene</li>
<li>active clip -- not sure what this is</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are notes I took from
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/files/relative_paths.html">Data System &gt; Relative Paths</a>.</p>
<p>You cannot enter relative paths into a new untitled blend-file; save it before linking to external files.</p>
<p>From the <em>Save As</em> function, you have the option to select <em>Remap Relative</em> to relocate a blend-file relative to its linked resources.</p>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> Continue from <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/files/import_export.html">Importing and Exporting Files</a>.</p>
<p>The following are notes I took from
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/command_line/index.html">Advanced &gt; Command Line</a>.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/command_line/introduction.html">Advanced &gt; Command Line &gt; Introduction</a>
to learn how to run Blender from the command line.
On my Mac, I launched Blender from the command line with the following command.</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the above command I used is different than the example shown in the Blender documentation.  You may need to similarly adjust what you read in the documentation.</p>
<p>Take careful notice of the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/command_line/arguments.html#argument-order">Argument Order</a> section.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/scripting/index.html">Scripting and Extending Blender</a>.</p>
<p><em>Optional Assignment:</em> Create an <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/advanced/app_templates.html">Application Template</a> that is used with your scene generation code.</p>
<p>Make note of <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/troubleshooting/python.html">Python Errors</a>.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/glossary/index.html">Glossary</a> as needed.</p>
