      <h1>CSE 1010</h1>
<p><strong>THIS COURSE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT.  THIS WIKI IS A WORKING COPY OF EVOLVING COURSE INSTRUCTIONS AND MATERIALS.</strong></p>
<h2>Course title and description</h2>
<p><s><em>CSE 1010 Computer Programming in Context</em></s></p>
<p><em>CSE 1010 Introduction to Computer Programming</em></p>
<p>Students learn to code using a scripting language such as Python or Javascript.
Language syntax, basic data types, control flow, functions, classes, data structures,
command line and graphical user interfaces, application programming interfaces (APIs),
automation experiments in one or more contexts such as animation, simulation, Web publishing, etc. 
(3 units)</p>
<h2>Course activities</h2>
<p>Do 10 weeks of core activities.</p>
<p><strong>Core activities</strong></p>

</ul>
<h2>Pedagogy</h2>
<p>Use writing to support learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use note taking to support the attainment of skills.  A learning history is a written record of what you read, thought about and experimented with when trying to develop a new skill needed to solve a problem.  (Develop an example.)</li>
<li>Use writing to support problem solving tasks.  Students write documentation as part of the process of solving computer programming problems.  (Develop an example.)</li>
<li>Use writing to support the attainment of skills.  (Example)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply the scientific method to personal learning tasks.  Students formulate clear hypotheses before running computer programming experiments.  The results of programming experiments are clearly predicted prior to running the experiment.  Easy-to-knock-off experiments tempt the learner into shallow guessing; experiments should lead to improvements in conceptual understanding within a given problem domain.</p>
<p>Teach how to learn.  This is easy: just show how to do it.  Learn something new with the class.  Demonstrate the creative process of learning.</p>
