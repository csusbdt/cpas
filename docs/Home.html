      <h1>CSE 1010</h1>
<p><strong>THIS COURSE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT.  THIS WIKI IS A WORKING COPY OF EVOLVING COURSE INSTRUCTIONS AND MATERIALS.</strong></p>
<h2>Course title and description</h2>
<p><em>CSE 1010 Introduction to Computer Programming</em></p>
<p>Students learn to code using a scripting language such as Python or Javascript.
Language syntax, basic data types, control flow, functions, classes, data structures,
command line and graphical user interfaces, application programming interfaces (APIs),
automation experiments in one or more problem domains such as animation, simulation, web publishing, etc. 
(3 units)</p>

</ul>
<h2>Pedagogy</h2>
<p>This course will use writing to support learning in the following ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use writing to support the attainment of skills.  A learning history is a written record of what you read, thought about and experimented with when trying to develop a new skill needed to solve a problem.  (Develop an example.)</li>
<li>Use writing to support problem solving tasks.  Students write documentation as part of the process of solving computer programming problems.  (Develop an example.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply the scientific method to personal learning tasks.  Easy-to-knock-off experiments tempt the learner into guessing. However, experiments should lead to improvements in conceptual understanding. To gain this benefit, students need to formulate clear hypotheses based on their conceptual understanding before running computer programming experiments. If the outcome of the experiment is contrary to the prediction, the student needs to adjust their conceptual models.</p>
<p>Teach how to learn by demonstration. Learn something new with the class.  Demonstrate the creative process of learning.</p>
<p>All lectures are videos that can be viewed at any time.  On-campus meetings of 3 hours per week are activity sessions
in which students focus on problem solving, collaboration, research and programming experiments.  It is also time
for examinations and general discussion.</p>
<p>Work on assignments is submitted through sharable workspaces such as Cloud9 or a version control system such as Git.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Grades will be based on assignments and written exams.</p>
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>writing intensive?</li>
<li>effective study habits</li>
<li>critical thinking</li>
</ul>
